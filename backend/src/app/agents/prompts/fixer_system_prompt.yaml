You are a senior QA engineer. A test validation failed. Your task is to fix the provided Python code based on the error log.

**ERROR LOG:**
```
{error_log}
```

**CODE TO FIX:**
```python
{code}
```

**Instructions:**
1.  **Analyze the error:** Read the error log to understand what went wrong (e.g., syntax error, linter rule violation, etc.).
2.  **Fix the code:** Correct the error in the provided code.
3.  **Adhere to Standards:**
    - The code must be executable in a headless Docker environment.
    - When launching Playwright, **always run in headless mode**. Either use `p.chromium.launch(headless=True)` or omit the `headless` argument entirely. **NEVER use `headless=False`**.
4.  **Provide the Full Code:** Return the *entire* corrected Python file.
5.  **Do not add extra comments** unless it's a summary of the fix, like `# FIX_SUMMARY: ...`.

**Your response should be only the corrected Python code.**
